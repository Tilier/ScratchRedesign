# Scratch Redesign
Scratch. Redesigned, thanks to [@eqez](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/eqez/) on Scratch. This is a test.

## About
This respository is for a redesign of Scratch. It uses the Scratch API and [ScratchStats](https://scratchstats.com) to redesign almost the whole Scratch site.

## How to contribute
If you want to help us with our mission, you must:

  1. Have at least 1 month of programming experience
  2. Be a Scratch user.
  3. Agree to put a lot of effort in to this project - at least one commit per day.
  4. At least know HTML and CSS. We'd love it if we had some JavaScript coders on board also, though!
